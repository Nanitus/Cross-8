Cross - Playability

This update is a playable demo of the game itself, along with all the updates provided so far and all the assets shown in the past.

This game is meant to have a similar gameplay style to that of a Megaman game, a platformer that gives the player the ability to shoot forward and change how they shoot. The next thing that I want to work on for this game: 
More weapons and abilities obtainable
More enemies that are harder to deal with
Better graphics for the game rather than simple shapes
Polish the game to make more fluid and accurate code and animations.
