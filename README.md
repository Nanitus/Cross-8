Cross - Playability

This update is all the files that I used to create the game, every script in this update are the final ones for the playable demo of the game. Some of the scripts were updated a bit to look more neat.

This game is meant to have a similar gameplay style to that of a Megaman game, a platformer that gives the player the ability to shoot forward and change how they shoot. The next thing that I want to work on for this game: 
More weapons and abilities obtainable
More enemies that are harder to deal with
Better graphics for the game rather than simple shapes
Polish the game to make more fluid and accurate code and animations.
